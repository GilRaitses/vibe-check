# 🔍 Gemini-Powered Tessellation Debugger

## Overview

The **Gemini Tessellation Debugger** is an AI-powered visual analysis tool that uses Google's Gemini Vision AI to analyze your NYC camera zone tessellation and provide detailed feedback on geographic accuracy. This gives you "eyes" to see exactly how your tessellation logic is failing and specific recommendations for improvement.

## 🎯 What It Does

1. **Visual Analysis**: Takes screenshots of your tessellation and analyzes them with Gemini Vision AI
2. **Geographic Validation**: Scores accuracy against real NYC geography (coastlines, boroughs, water exclusion)
3. **Technical Feedback**: Provides specific code improvements and algorithm suggestions
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Tracks progress across multiple iterations until perfect accuracy
5. **Automated Processing**: Can watch for new screenshots and auto-analyze them

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Take a Screenshot
First, take a screenshot of your current tessellation dashboard and save it to the `screenshots/` directory:

```bash
# Save your tessellation screenshot as:
screenshots/tessellation-current.png
```

### 2. Run the Debugger
```bash
# Analyze your tessellation
node scripts/gemini-tessellation-debugger.js screenshots/tessellation-current.png
```

### 3. Apply Improvements
The debugger will provide:
- **Accuracy Score** (1-100): How well your tessellation matches NYC geography  
- **Specific Issues**: What's wrong with the current tessellation
- **Code Improvements**: Technical fixes to apply
- **Coastline Coordinates**: Improved boundary points

### 4. Iterate Until Perfect
Repeat the process with each improvement until you achieve 95+ accuracy score.

## 📊 Analysis Features

### Geographic Accuracy Scoring

The debugger evaluates your tessellation on multiple criteria:

- **Coastline Accuracy**: Do zone boundaries follow actual NYC coastline?
- **Water Exclusion**: Are water areas properly excluded (no zones over rivers/harbor)?
- **Geographic Precision**: Do zones stay within NYC boundaries?
- **Bridge Handling**: Are bridge areas properly included as land areas?
- **Overall Shape**: Does the tessellation match NYC's actual island shape?

### Visual Problems It Detects

- ❌ **Zones extending into New Jersey/Connecticut**
- ❌ **Camera zones over water areas** (Hudson River, East River, NY Harbor)
- ❌ **Incorrect coastline boundaries** 
- ❌ **Missing bridge connections**
- ❌ **Poor borough boundary adherence**

## 🔧 Usage Modes

### Manual Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# Analyze specific screenshot
node scripts/gemini-tessellation-debugger.js screenshots/my-tessellation.png
```

### Auto-Watch Mode
```bash
# Continuously watch for new screenshots
node scripts/gemini-tessellation-debugger.js --auto
```

In auto-watch mode, the debugger monitors the `screenshots/` directory and automatically analyzes any new PNG/JPG files you add.

🔄 DEBUG ITERATION 1
==================================================
🤖 Analyzing tessellation screenshot: screenshots/tessellation-v1.png

📊 GEMINI ANALYSIS:
ACCURACY SCORE: 25/100

SPECIFIC ISSUES:
- Major coastline violations: zones extend far into New Jersey
- Water exclusion failure: zones cover Hudson River and East River
- Geographic precision poor: tessellation boundary is too simplistic
- Bridge handling missing: no special treatment for bridge areas

COASTLINE PROBLEMS:
- West side boundary extends ~2 miles beyond actual Manhattan shoreline
- No consideration of complex Staten Island coastline
- Brooklyn/Queens boundary completely ignores Jamaica Bay

IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:
1. Use high-resolution NYC coastline data as hard boundary constraint
2. Implement water body exclusion using point-in-polygon checks
3. Add bridge detection and special handling for bridge areas
4. Use multi-level boundary validation (borough -> neighborhood -> street)

🎯 ACCURACY SCORE: 25/100

🔧 SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:
[Detailed JavaScript code improvements provided...]

💾 Debug results saved to tessellation-debug-1.json

🔄 Ready for next iteration. Apply improvements and re-run.
```

## 📁 Output Files

Each debugging iteration creates a detailed report:

```
reports/tessellation-debug-1.json
```

Contains:
- Iteration number and timestamp
- Accuracy score and full analysis
- Improved coastline coordinates
- Specific code improvements
- Session progress tracking

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Target**: Achieve **95+ accuracy score**

**Perfect Tessellation Should Have**:
- ✅ Zones perfectly constrained to NYC landmass
- ✅ No zones over water (rivers, harbor, ocean)
- ✅ Accurate coastline following (including complex areas like Staten Island)
- ✅ Proper bridge area inclusion
- ✅ Clear borough boundary respect
- ✅ No extension into NJ, CT, or other non-NYC areas

## 🔄 Iterative Workflow

1. **Take Screenshot** → Save tessellation image
2. **Run Debugger** → Get AI analysis and score
3. **Apply Fixes** → Implement suggested improvements
4. **Re-generate** → Create new tessellation with fixes
5. **Repeat** → Until 95+ accuracy achieved

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Getting Better Screenshots
- Use full-screen tessellation dashboard
- Ensure good contrast between zones and background
- Include geographic context (state boundaries, water bodies)
- Save as PNG for best quality

### Interpreting Feedback
- Focus on **highest-impact issues** first (coastline, water exclusion)
- **Coastline coordinates** provided can be directly used in your algorithm
- **Code improvements** are specific and actionable
- **Score progression** shows if you're improving or regressing

### Common Fixes Applied
- Adding NYC borough boundary constraints
- Implementing water body exclusion algorithms
- Using high-resolution coastline data
- Adding bridge area detection
- Improving point-in-polygon validation

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Screenshot not found"
```bash
# Make sure file exists
ls -la screenshots/
```

### "Failed to analyze tessellation"
- Check your Gemini API key is set: `export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key`
- Ensure screenshot is readable (PNG/JPG format)
- Image should be clear and not corrupted

### Low accuracy scores persisting
- Apply **all** suggested improvements, not just some
- Focus on **major issues** first (coastline, water exclusion)
- Consider starting with **simpler boundary constraints** before complex ones

## 🎉 Success Stories

Once you achieve **95+ accuracy**, your tessellation will:
- Perfectly match NYC's actual geography
- Exclude all water areas appropriately  
- Handle complex coastlines and bridge areas correctly
- Provide accurate camera zone boundaries for your vibe-check system

This gives you the foundation for **highly accurate** pedestrian safety analysis that respects real-world geographic constraints.

## 🔗 Integration

The debugger integrates with your existing tessellation pipeline:

```javascript
// In your tessellation generation script
const { TessellationDebugger } = require('./scripts/gemini-tessellation-debugger');

// After generating tessellation, auto-analyze it
const debugger = new TessellationDebugger();
await debugger.debugIteration('screenshots/latest-tessellation.png');
```
