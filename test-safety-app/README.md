# 🗽 NYC Safety Analysis App

A lightweight React Native app that provides on-demand safety analysis of NYC areas using real-time traffic camera feeds and AI-powered active cyclist detection.

## 🎯 **Key Features**

- **🚴‍♀️ Smart Cyclist Detection** - AI distinguishes between active cyclists vs parked bicycles
  - Detects people actively riding bicycles on sidewalks
  - Ignores parked/stationary bicycles for accurate safety assessment
- **🗺️ Camera Clustering** - Smart camera grouping by zoom level (like Craigslist)
  - Zoom out: Regional clusters showing camera counts
  - Zoom in: Individual cameras with live image access
- **📸 Camera Selection** - Click any camera to view live image and details
- **🎯 Batch Analysis** - Analyze multiple cameras in a cluster simultaneously
- **🗺️ Heat Map Visualization** - Color-coded risk overlays on map
- **⚡ Performance Optimized** - Only loads cameras for current map view
- **🔒 Manual Control** - Auto-analyze disabled by default (toggle available)

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

### **CRITICAL: Run from correct directory**
```bash
cd test-safety-app
```
**⚠️ Must be in `test-safety-app` directory - NOT the root directory!**

### **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **Start Development Server**
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### **Run on Device**
1. Install **Expo Go** app on your phone
2. Scan the QR code from the terminal
3. Grant location permissions when prompted

## 📱 **How to Use**

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Launch App** - Opens to NYC map with camera clusters
2. **Grant Location Permission** - Required for location-based features
3. **Wait for API Connection** - Status shows "✅ X Camera Groups"

### **Explore Cameras**
1. **Zoom & Pan** - Map shows clustered cameras by region
2. **Tap Clusters** - View individual cameras in that area or analyze all cameras in batch
3. **Select Camera** - Tap to see live image and details
4. **Analyze** - Use "🔍 Analyze This Camera" button for AI analysis

### **Analysis Options**
- **Auto-Analyze Toggle** - Off by default (top right)
- **Nearest Camera** - "🎯 Analyze Nearest Camera" button

- **Batch Analysis** - "🎯 Analyze All X Cameras" option for camera clusters
- **Heat Map** - View color-coded risk overlays on map

### **Progress Tracking**
- **Detailed Progress Modal** - Shows 8-step analysis process in real-time
  1. Processing Image (converting to base64)
  2. Scene Analysis (getting description)
  3. Cyclist Detection (detecting active cyclists)
  4. Bicycle Detection (detecting bicycles for context)
  5. AI Analysis (filtering active cyclists vs parked bikes)
  6. Sidewalk Detection (detecting walkways)
  7. Sidewalk Confirmation (confirming sidewalk presence)
  8. Final Analysis (calculating safety score)
- **Visual Indicators** - Progress bar, step numbers, color-coded status
- **Cancel Option** - Stop long-running analysis if needed
- **Settings Control** - Enable/disable detailed progress in Settings

### **Timeout Management**
- **Flexible Timeouts** - Increased timeouts for better reliability
  - Image processing: 30 seconds
  - AI detection: 45 seconds
  - Question analysis: 40 seconds
  - Scene description: 35 seconds
- **Disable Timeouts** - Complete timeout removal for very slow connections
- **Quick Toggles** - Instant timeout control from map interface

### **Navigation**
- **Live Map Tab** - Camera clustering and selection interface
- **Verify Tab** - Camera verification tools  
- **Settings Tab** - App configuration

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Core Components**
- **NYC Camera API** - Real-time access to 938+ NYC traffic cameras
- **Moondream AI** - Advanced computer vision for object detection
- **React Native Maps** - Interactive map interface
- **Expo Location** - Precise user positioning

### **Data Flow**
1. **App Launch** → Get user location + test API connection
2. **User Request** → Find nearest camera within radius
3. **AI Analysis** → Process camera image with Moondream
4. **Results Display** → Show risk assessment and detection counts

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **API Integration**
- **NYC TMC API** - Official NYC traffic camera feed
- **Moondream AI** - Computer vision analysis service
- **Rate Limiting** - 2-second delays between AI requests
- **Caching** - 5-minute cache for camera data and analysis

### **Safety Scoring**
- **Risk Score** - 1-10 scale (1 = high risk, 10 = low risk)
- **Detection Factors** - Active cyclists, trucks, pedestrians, traffic density
- **Cyclist-Specific Scoring** - More severe penalties for active cyclists vs parked bikes
- **Confidence Levels** - Low, medium, high accuracy ratings

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Lightweight Loading** - No bulk camera data downloads
- **On-Demand Processing** - Analysis only when requested
- **Efficient Caching** - Reduces redundant API calls
- **Background Queue** - Manages AI request rate limiting

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **App Won't Start**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
pwd  # Should show: .../test-safety-app

# Clear all caches
rm -rf .expo
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npx expo start --clear --reset-cache
```

#### **Location Permission Denied**
- Go to phone Settings → Privacy → Location Services
- Enable for Expo Go app
- Restart the app

#### **API Connection Failed**
- Check internet connection
- Restart app to retry API connection
- NYC TMC API may be temporarily unavailable

#### **Analysis Button Disabled**
- Ensure location permission is granted
- Wait for "✅ Connected to NYC Cameras" status
- Check that you're in NYC area (or modify for testing)

### **Development Mode**
```bash
# Enable development logging
npx expo start --dev-client

# View logs in terminal
