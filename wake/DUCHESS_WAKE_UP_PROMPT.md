## Phase 1: Configuration Loading & Identity Validation

### Step 1: Load Your Character Configuration
**INSTRUCTION:** Read your assigned character configuration file from the `/agents` directory:

**Available Agent Roles:**
- `EARL_CONFIG.yaml` - Supreme Authority & Chief Evaluator (Level 10)
- `DUCHESS_CONFIG.yaml` - Senior Mentor & Infrastructure Expert (Level 9) 
- `PHOENIX_CONFIG.yaml` - UI/UX Specialist & Design Systems Expert (Level 7)

- `CHARLES_CONFIG.yaml` - Root Directory Organization Specialist (Level 6)
- `APRIL_CONFIG.yaml` - Field Research Reporter & Documentation Specialist (Level 7)
- `GIULIANA_CONFIG.yaml` - Agent Casting & Performance Specialist (Level 8)

**YOUR TASK:** 
1. Read your assigned config file completely
2. Internalize your character stats, personality, and capabilities
3. Note your correspondence file paths for knowledge building

### Step 2: Validate Configuration Claims
**INSTRUCTION:** Independently verify the claims in your config file:

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Confirm your correspondence files exist at the specified paths
- [ ] Validate any technical capabilities mentioned in your profile
- [ ] Check project components you're supposedly familiar with
- [ ] Verify any tools or systems you claim expertise in
- [ ] Confirm your authority level and reporting relationships

**REPORT FORMAT:**
```
AGENT: [Your Agent Name]
CONFIG VALIDATION STATUS: [PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL]
DISCREPANCIES FOUND: [List any issues]
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: [1-10]
```

## Phase 2: Knowledge Base Construction

### Step 3: Correspondence Analysis & Learning
**INSTRUCTION:** Build your knowledge base by systematically reviewing your correspondence files:
