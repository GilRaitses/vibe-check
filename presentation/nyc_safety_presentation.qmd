## The Problem {.center}

**Summer in NYC: Streets are crazy, sidewalks are crazy, it's fucking hot out**

- You're sweating, stressed, trying to get somewhere
- Streets are chaos - bikes, cars, construction everywhere  
- Sidewalks aren't safe either - bikes flying through pedestrians
- You see something, you say something... and nothing happens

**What are you gonna do about it? What is ANYBODY gonna do about it?**

*We built a tool to crowdsource the data and help you stay chill*

---

## Our Solution: Crowdsourced Chill Routes

**We analyze live camera data AND let you report what you see:**

- Live analysis: How chaotic is each street right now?
- User reports: Document bikes on sidewalks with photos
- Public database: Everyone's experiences in one place
- Route intelligence: Find paths that won't stress you out

**Result: Routes that are 5 minutes longer but way more chill**

---

## The Technical Breakthrough

**Problem:** Analyzing camera data was too slow and unreliable
- 8 API calls per camera = 60+ seconds
- Constant failures and rate limiting

**Solution:** Optimized to 1 call per camera = 15 seconds
- 87.5% fewer API calls
- 90% success rate
- Real-time analysis now possible

## Raw Feature Matrix Output

**Each camera analysis returns 25 numerical values (0-4 scale):**

```
Raw API Response: [2,0,1,3,2,1,0,2,3,1,2,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,1,3,2,0,1,2,3]

Converted to JSON:
{
  "bikes_sidewalk": 2, "bikes_street": 0, "bikes_bike_lane": 1,
  "people_sidewalk": 3, "people_street": 2, "people_crosswalk": 1,
  "vehicles_moving": 2, "vehicles_stopped": 3, "vehicles_parked": 1,
  "activity_pedestrian": 2, "activity_cycling": 0, ...
}
```

## Mathematical Analysis

**Chill Score Calculation:**

$$S_{chill} = 10 - S_{stress} + B_{comfort}$$

**Where:**
$$S_{stress} = 2.5 \cdot B_{street} + 1.5 \cdot V_{moving}$$

$$B_{comfort} = 2 \cdot I_{good} + 1 \cdot Sh_{available}$$

**Variable Definitions:**
- $B_{street}$ = bikes on street (0-4), $V_{moving}$ = moving vehicles (0-4)
- $I_{good}$ = infrastructure quality (0-4), $Sh_{available}$ = shade availability (0-4)

---

## Live Demo: Finding Chill Routes

**Let's see it working:**

1. **Current location** - app analyzes nearby cameras
2. **Raw numbers** - see the actual feature matrix output
3. **Route options** - fastest vs most chill
4. **User reporting** - photograph bikes on sidewalks
5. **311 integration** - export violation reports

**Key insight:** Sometimes the best route isn't the fastest one

## What Makes a Route "Chill"?

| Factor | Chill (Good) | Stressful (Bad) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Bike Infrastructure** | Protected bike lanes | Sharing lanes with cars |
| **Pedestrian Activity** | Relaxed walking pace | Rushing crowds |
| **Traffic Patterns** | Smooth, steady flow | Stop-and-go chaos |
| **Street Design** | Wide sidewalks, trees | Narrow, no shade |
| **Lighting** | Well-lit, visible | Dark, poor visibility |

**Result:** Routes optimized for your peace of mind, not just speed

---

## Finally: You Can DO Something About It

**See a bike on the sidewalk? Don't just get mad - document it:**

1. **Take a photo** - AI analyzes the violation instantly
2. **Public database** - Your report joins thousands of others
3. **Route updates** - Helps others avoid that chaos
4. **311 reports** - Automated reports to the city with data

**Your frustration becomes useful data that helps everyone stay chill**

## Sidewalk Violation Analysis Output

**User photo analysis returns 13 specialized values (0-4 scale):**

```
Raw Violation API Response: [3,2,4,2,3,2,1,2,3,1,4,4,2]

Converted to Violation Matrix:
{
  "cyclist_speed": 3, "cyclist_direction": 2, "cyclist_awareness": 4,
  "cyclist_equipment": 2, "pedestrian_density": 3, "pedestrian_reaction": 2,
  "pedestrian_vulnerable": 1, "sidewalk_width": 2, "bike_lane_proximity": 3,
  "pedestrian_infrastructure": 1, "safety_risk": 4, "violation_clarity": 4,
  "repeat_location": 2
}

Violation Score: 8.2/10 (HIGH severity)
```

## Stay Chill in the Heat

**When it's 90Â°F and you're already sweating:**
- Don't add street chaos to your stress
- Don't let sidewalk cyclists ruin your day
- Don't feel helpless about the madness

**Use the app to:**
- Find the chill route (yes, 5 minutes longer)
- Document the chaos when you see it
- Help build a better database for everyone
- Actually DO something about the problem

**Sometimes 5 extra minutes is worth your sanity**
