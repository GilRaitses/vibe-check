# Vibe-Check Development Log - 2025-06-23

## Project Overview
Creating a new **vibe-check** repository that implements a Gemini-powered AI orchestration system for NYC safety analysis. This is a complete architectural evolution from the existing test-safety-app, with Gemini acting as a central intelligent agent.

## Today's Objectives

### 1. Repository Setup âœ…
- [x] Created new `vibe-check` repository at `/Users/gilraitses/vibe-check`
- [x] Initialized Git repository
- [x] Set up Angular frontend with SSR/SSG capabilities
- [x] Created orchestrator backend structure

### 2. Gemini Orchestration Architecture ðŸ”„
**Goal**: Create a self-supervised AI agent that manages all safety analysis services

#### Core Components:
- **Gemini Orchestrator Agent**: Central AI that controls narrative, interprets results, oversees metrics
- **Configuration Management**: AI-driven configuration of vision, data, and violation services  
- **Self-Supervised Auditing**: Regular self-assessment and optimization
- **Modular Service Architecture**: Vision, ViolationSanity, Data, Reporting services

#### Key Features:
- **Adaptive Configuration**: Gemini modifies service configs based on performance
- **Continuous Learning**: Post-processing with time-series integration
- **Regulatory Auditing**: Scheduled self-audits and performance reports
- **Feature Matrix Management**: AI-controlled feature matrices for Moondream calls

### 3. Service Modernization
**ViolationSanity Service** (new name for sidewalk violation detection):
- Simplified modular design with own config
- 13 variables reduced to cleaner architecture
- Managed by Gemini agent

### 4. Firebase Deployment Plan ðŸŽ¯
**Target**: Create deployable demo that people can clone and test

#### Firebase Services:
- **Hosting**: Angular frontend with SSR
- **Functions**: Gemini orchestrator backend
- **Firestore**: Configuration and analysis data storage
- **Storage**: Image upload and processing
- **Authentication**: Demo user management

#### Demo Features:
- Interactive web interface
- Real-time analysis visualization
- Configuration management dashboard
- Performance metrics display
- Easy clone-and-deploy setup

### 5. Development Progress

#### Completed:
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Angular frontend initialized (zoneless, SSR enabled)
- [x] Shared types system designed
- [x] Gemini orchestrator agent architecture
- [x] Service interfaces defined

#### In Progress:
- [ ] Service implementations (VisionService, ViolationSanityService, etc.)
- [ ] Firebase configuration
- [ ] Angular components for orchestrator interface
- [ ] Configuration management UI

#### Next Steps:
- [ ] Implement service classes
- [ ] Create Firebase project setup
- [ ] Build Angular dashboard components
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Technical Architecture

### Gemini Agent Capabilities:
1. **Configuration Orchestration**: Manages configs for all services
2. **Analysis Coordination**: Coordinates vision and violation analysis
3. **Self-Supervised Auditing**: Regular performance assessment
4. **Adaptive Optimization**: Modifies parameters based on performance
5. **Report Generation**: Automated reporting at configurable intervals

### Service Architecture:
```
Gemini Orchestrator (Central AI)
â”œâ”€â”€ Configuration Manager
â”œâ”€â”€ Vision Service â†’ Moondream API
â”œâ”€â”€ ViolationSanity Service â†’ Simplified violation detection
â”œâ”€â”€ Data Source Service â†’ External data integration
â””â”€â”€ Reporting Service â†’ Automated reports
```

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: Angular 18+ (SSR/SSG, zoneless)
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Vision**: Moondream API (managed by Gemini)
- **Deployment**: Firebase (Hosting + Functions)
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage

## Firebase Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Deployment
- Set up Firebase project
- Deploy Angular frontend to Hosting
- Deploy orchestrator as Cloud Function
- Configure Firestore for data storage

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Real-time analysis updates
- User authentication for demo
- Advanced dashboard with metrics
- Performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Production Ready
- Horizontal scaling configuration
- Advanced security rules
- Comprehensive documentation
- Community deployment guides

## Key Innovations

### 1. AI-Driven Configuration
- Gemini agent adaptively modifies service configurations
- Self-learning system that improves over time
- Automated parameter tuning based on performance

### 2. Self-Supervised Auditing
- Regular self-assessment of analysis quality
- Automated reporting on system health
- Configuration recommendations based on audit results

### 3. Modular Service Design
- Clean separation of concerns
- Each service has its own configuration
- Centralized orchestration without tight coupling

### 4. Continuous Transformation
- Post-processing with time-series integration
- Statistical analysis of trends
- Dynamic feature matrix optimization

## Expected Outcomes

### For Users:
- Easy-to-use web interface for safety analysis
- Real-time feedback on analysis quality
- Downloadable reports and insights
- Simple clone-and-deploy process

### For Developers:
- Well-documented API
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Firebase-ready deployment
- Comprehensive test coverage

### For Community:
- Open-source safety analysis platform
- Reproducible research results
- Community-driven improvements
- Educational resource for AI orchestration

## Development Notes

### Challenges Identified:
1. **Service Coordination**: Ensuring smooth communication between Gemini and services
2. **Configuration Validation**: Preventing AI from creating invalid configs
3. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing AI decision-making with response time
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services fail

### Solutions Implemented:
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate via events
2. **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for all configuration changes
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Rule-based fallbacks when AI fails
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Winston-based logging for debugging

## Next Session Goals

1. **Complete Service Implementation**: Finish all service classes
2. **Firebase Setup**: Create and configure Firebase project
3. **Angular Dashboard**: Build orchestrator management interface
