   - **Maximum weight** (4.0) assigned to bike red light running
   - **15-minute update frequency** for critical intersections

2. **Enhanced Detection Variables**

   - Updated vision prompt to emphasize bike red light violations as **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
   - Specific detection prompts for intersection endangerment scenarios

3. **Critical Location Configurations**
   - **Hell's Kitchen**: Pedestrian walkway violations (bikes on concrete walkways)
   - **Amsterdam Avenue**: Dangerous bike lane positioning between cars/curb
   - **High Traffic Intersections**: Bike red light violation focus (NEW)
