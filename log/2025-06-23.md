# Vibe-Check Development Log - 2025-06-23

## Project Overview
Creating a new **vibe-check** repository that implements a Gemini-powered AI orchestration system for NYC safety analysis. This is a complete architectural evolution from the existing test-safety-app, with Gemini acting as a central intelligent agent.

## Today's Objectives
