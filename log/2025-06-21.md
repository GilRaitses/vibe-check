# Implementation Plan: Integrating TensorFlow.js and Bike Detection

## Date: 2025-06-21

### Overview
This document outlines the steps to integrate TensorFlow.js and a pre-trained object detection model (COCO-SSD) into the test-safety-app. The goal is to detect bikes on sidewalks using the device camera and update safety scores for each block on the map.

---

## Steps

1. **Set Up Camera Functionality**
   - [x] Add a Camera screen using `expo-camera`.
   - [x] Allow users to capture images and display the result.

2. **Integrate TensorFlow.js**
   - [x] Install `@tensorflow/tfjs` and `@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native`.
   - [x] Initialize TensorFlow.js in the app.
   - [x] Load the COCO-SSD pre-trained model for object detection.

3. **Run Bike Detection on Captured Images**
   - [x] Convert the captured image to a tensor.
   - [x] Run the image through the COCO-SSD model.
   - [x] Parse the results to count detected bikes.

4. **Display Detection Results**
   - [x] Show the number of detected bikes on the Camera screen.
   - [x] Overlay bounding boxes on detected bikes.

5. **Update Safety Scores on the Map**
   - [x] Associate detection results with the user's current location/block.
   - [x] Update the safety score for the relevant block on the map.

6. **Integrate Mappable SDK**
   - [x] Replace react-native-maps with Mappable SDK.
   - [x] Implement Mappable location services.
   - [x] Add location-based block identification.

## Progress Update (TensorFlow.js Integration)
- The Camera screen now integrates TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model.
- After taking a picture, the app runs bike detection and displays the number of detected bikes.
- A loading indicator is shown while processing.
- Error handling is in place for detection failures.

## Progress Update (Bounding Box Visualization)
- Red bounding boxes are drawn over detected bikes in the captured image.
- Boxes are scaled to match the displayed image dimensions.
- Detection results are clearly displayed with bike count.

## Progress Update (Map Integration)
- Created a shared SafetyContext to manage safety data between screens.
- Safety Map now shows dynamic safety scores with color-coded markers.
- Camera screen can update safety scores that immediately reflect on the map.
- Added a safety legend and test update functionality.
- Safety scores are calculated as: 10 - bike_count (10 = safe, 1 = dangerous).

## Progress Update (Mappable SDK Integration)
- Replaced react-native-maps with Mappable SDK (`@mappable/mappable-js` and `@mappable/mappable-react-native`).
- Created MappableMapComponent with custom markers and location services.
- Integrated MappableLocation for real-time user location tracking.
- Added nearest block detection using Haversine distance calculation.
- Camera screen now shows nearest block information and updates the correct block.
- Added location info panel showing user coordinates.
- Implemented location permission handling and error management.

## Progress Update (Simplified Testing Version)
- Created fallback implementation using react-native-maps for testing
- Simplified Camera screen with demo mode (simulates bike detection)
- Removed TensorFlow.js dependencies temporarily for easier testing
- App is now ready for basic functionality testing

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- iPhone or Android device
- Expo Go app installed
- Computer and phone on same WiFi network

### Step 1: Install Expo Go
- **iPhone**: Download "Expo Go" from the App Store
- **Android**: Download "Expo Go" from Google Play Store

### Step 2: Start the App
```bash
cd test-safety-app
npm start
```

### Step 3: Scan QR Code
- **iPhone**: Open Camera app ‚Üí point at QR code ‚Üí tap notification
- **Android**: Open Expo Go app ‚Üí "Scan QR Code" ‚Üí point at QR code

### Step 4: Grant Permissions
When the app opens, allow:
- **Camera permission** (to take photos)
- **Location permission** (to find your nearest block)

### Step 5: Test Features

#### Camera Tab Testing:
1. **Take Picture**: Tap "Take Picture" to capture a photo
2. **Location Info**: Check if nearest block is displayed
3. **Simulate Detection**: Tap "Simulate Bike Detection" to test safety score updates
4. **Verify Updates**: Check that the alert shows correct block and safety score

#### Safety Map Tab Testing:
1. **View Map**: See your current location (blue dot)
2. **Safety Markers**: View colored markers for different blocks
   - üü¢ Green (7-10): Safe
   - üü† Orange (4-6): Moderate  
   - üî¥ Red (1-3): Dangerous
3. **Test Updates**: Tap "Test Update (Random)" to simulate random updates
4. **Location Button**: Tap "üìç My Location" to center map on your position
5. **Marker Interaction**: Tap on markers to see block details

#### Explore Tab Testing:
- View the original demo content and documentation

### Step 6: Verify Integration
1. Take a photo in Camera tab
2. Simulate bike detection
3. Switch to Safety Map tab
4. Verify the safety score has been updated for the correct block
5. Check that the marker color has changed accordingly

### Troubleshooting

#### QR Code Issues:
- Ensure phone and computer are on same WiFi network
- Try manually entering URL: `exp://10.4.32.157:8081`
- Restart Expo server if needed

#### Permission Issues:
- Go to phone Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Camera/Location
- Ensure Expo Go has necessary permissions

#### App Crashes:
- Shake phone to open developer menu
- Tap "Reload" to restart app
- Check terminal for error logs

#### Location Not Working:
- Ensure location services are enabled on phone
- Grant location permission when prompted
- Check if GPS is enabled

## Next Steps
- Test detection accuracy and performance on a real device.
- Add your Mappable API key to the configuration.
- Implement data persistence for safety scores.
- Add user authentication and community reporting features.
- Test Mappable SDK functionality on physical devices.
- Re-integrate TensorFlow.js for real bike detection.

## Technical Implementation Details
- **TensorFlow.js**: Using COCO-SSD model for object detection
- **State Management**: React Context for shared safety data
- **Map Integration**: Mappable SDK with custom markers and location services
- **Image Processing**: Base64 encoding for TensorFlow.js compatibility
