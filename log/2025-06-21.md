# Implementation Plan: Integrating TensorFlow.js and Bike Detection

## Date: 2025-06-21

### Overview
This document outlines the steps to integrate TensorFlow.js and a pre-trained object detection model (COCO-SSD) into the test-safety-app. The goal is to detect bikes on sidewalks using the device camera and update safety scores for each block on the map.

---

## Steps

1. **Set Up Camera Functionality**
   - [x] Add a Camera screen using `expo-camera`.
   - [x] Allow users to capture images and display the result.

2. **Integrate TensorFlow.js**
   - [x] Install `@tensorflow/tfjs` and `@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native`.
   - [x] Initialize TensorFlow.js in the app.
   - [x] Load the COCO-SSD pre-trained model for object detection.

3. **Run Bike Detection on Captured Images**
   - [x] Convert the captured image to a tensor.
   - [x] Run the image through the COCO-SSD model.
   - [x] Parse the results to count detected bikes.

4. **Display Detection Results**
   - [x] Show the number of detected bikes on the Camera screen.
   - [x] Overlay bounding boxes on detected bikes.

5. **Update Safety Scores on the Map**
   - [x] Associate detection results with the user's current location/block.
   - [x] Update the safety score for the relevant block on the map.

6. **Integrate Mappable SDK**
   - [x] Replace react-native-maps with Mappable SDK.
   - [x] Implement Mappable location services.
   - [x] Add location-based block identification.

## Final Implementation (Rate Limiting & On-Demand Analysis)
**Date: 2025-06-21 - HACKATHON COMPLETION**

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: App was crashing due to overwhelming Moondream API with hundreds of simultaneous requests (429 rate limit errors)
- **Root Cause**: App automatically analyzed all nearby cameras when user location loaded
- **Impact**: App unusable due to immediate crashes and API rate limiting

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed All Fallback Methods**
   - Eliminated mock data and NYC Open Data fallbacks
   - Simplified to use only working NYC TMC API endpoint
   - Clean, production-ready code

2. **Implemented Proper Rate Limiting**
   - Added request queue with 2-second delays between calls
   - Maximum 1 concurrent request to Moondream API
   - Prevents overwhelming the API service

3. **Changed to On-Demand Analysis**
   - Removed automatic camera analysis on location load
   - Users must tap specific camera markers to trigger analysis
   - Prevents mass API calls on app startup

4. **Added Comprehensive Logging**
   - All Moondream API calls tagged with `[HACKATHON]` for easy tracking
   - Detailed logs for each step: camera info ‚Üí API calls ‚Üí results
   - Perfect for hackathon demonstration and debugging

### Technical Implementation Details
- **NYC Camera Service**: Uses only NYC TMC API (https://nyctmc.org/api/cameras)
- **Rate Limiting**: Queue system with 2-second delays, max 1 concurrent request
- **Analysis Trigger**: User-initiated via camera marker taps
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for all API interactions

### Final App Behavior
1. **Startup**: Loads user location and displays 938 NYC camera positions
2. **Camera Display**: Shows gray markers for all camera locations
3. **Analysis**: Only triggered when user taps specific camera markers
4. **Logging**: Detailed logs for each analysis with all API call details
5. **Heat Map**: Updates progressively as cameras are analyzed
6. **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits with proper queuing

- **Status**: üîÑ FIXING

### Issue 2: Still Calling Moondream Automatically  
- **Problem**: Logs show Moondream API calls without user confirmation
- **Evidence**: Terminal shows "üîç Analyzing camera C4-WST-03-Med_at_Vestry_St with Moondream AI..."
- **Root Cause**: Some trigger still causing automatic analysis
- **Impact**: Burning API credits and hitting rate limits
- **Status**: üîÑ INVESTIGATING
