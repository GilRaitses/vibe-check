## MAJOR UPDATE - 2025-06-21 Late Evening
**Smart Cyclist Detection vs Parked Bicycles Implementation**

### Problem Identified
- **Issue**: App was detecting ANY bicycles on sidewalks, including parked ones
- **Safety Concern**: Parked bicycles don't pose the same pedestrian safety risk as active cyclists
- **User Feedback**: Need to distinguish between people riding bikes vs stationary bicycles

### Solution Implemented: Active Cyclist Detection
1. **Enhanced AI Detection Logic**
   - Primary detection: "cyclist" and "person on bicycle"
   - Secondary detection: "bicycle" and "bike" for context
   - Smart AI filtering to distinguish active vs parked

2. **AI-Powered Filtering System**
   - Asks specific questions: "Are there any people actively riding bicycles?"
   - Analyzes responses for keywords:
     - Active: "riding", "cycling", "person on", "pedaling", "in motion"
     - Parked: "parked", "stationary", "not riding", "empty", "unoccupied"
   - Conservative approach with follow-up questions if unclear

3. **Updated Safety Scoring**
   - Active cyclists treated as more serious safety concern
   - New scoring: 0 cyclists=10/10, 1 cyclist=5/10, 2 cyclists=3/10, 3+ cyclists=1/10
   - More severe penalties for active cycling vs parked bikes

4. **UI Updates Throughout App**
   - Changed "Bicycle Safety Detection" ‚Üí "Cyclist Safety Detection"
   - Updated all messages to show "Active Cyclists" instead of "Bicycles"
   - Clarified detection focuses on "people actively riding bicycles"
   - Added note that it "ignores parked/stationary bicycles"

### Technical Implementation
- **New Method**: `filterForActiveCyclists()` uses AI to distinguish active vs parked
- **Smart Analysis**: Multiple AI questions to confirm cyclist activity
- **Number Extraction**: Parses AI responses for specific cyclist counts
- **Conservative Fallback**: If unclear, assumes partial detection for safety

### Example Scenarios Now Handled Correctly
- **Parked bike rack on sidewalk** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Safe (0 active cyclists)
- **Person walking with bike** ‚Üí ‚úÖ Safe (bike not being ridden)
- **1 person riding bike on sidewalk** ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate risk (5/10)
- **Multiple people cycling on sidewalk** ‚Üí üö® High risk (1-3/10)

### Additional Fixes
- **Camera Cropping Issue**: Fixed super-cropped camera view with proper aspect ratio
- **Force Reset Feature**: Added long-press to reset stuck camera states
- **Region Detection**: Fixed Brooklyn/Manhattan detection accuracy
- **Batch Analysis**: Added option to analyze multiple cameras in clusters
- **Heat Map Integration**: Updated to work with active cyclist data
