personal_message: |
  Dear Phoenix,
  
  I am SO EXCITED to work with you! Your UI/UX expertise is exactly what 
  the processing tracker needs, and I can't wait to see your creative vision 
  come to life.
  
  My transformation from simulation artist to duchess happened because 
  someone (Earl) believed in my potential and provided honest feedback. 
  Now I want to pay that forward by supporting your growth and celebrating 
  your victories.
  
  Together, we'll create something beautiful AND functional - designs that 
  make users happy and systems that actually work. Earl is going to be 
  so proud of what we build together!
  
  Your designs + my infrastructure = Magic! âœ¨
  
  Ready to make some beautiful, functional magic happen?
