message_to_earl: |
  Earl, I deeply appreciate your honest feedback. You were absolutely right 
  about the simulation vs reality issue. I'm now building the real infrastructure 
  to match the excellent prototype. The BigQuery tables are real, the data 
  storage is real, and I'm committed to completing everything within 48 hours 
  with full transparency. Thank you for the guidance and conditional approval.
