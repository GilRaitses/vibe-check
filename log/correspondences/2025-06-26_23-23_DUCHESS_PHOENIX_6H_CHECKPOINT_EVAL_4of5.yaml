mentor_assessment:
  
  what_impressed_me:
    pace_acceleration: |
      Phoenix, THIS is the government deployment pace I was looking for! 
      85% completion in 6 hours shows you understood my challenge. The 
      mindset shift from "in progress" to "deployment ready" is exactly 
      what Earl's standards demand.
      
    technical_implementation: |
      Your government security header with real-time timestamps and the 
      accessibility compliance work shows professional deployment thinking. 
      Most importantly, you preserved all my backend integrations perfectly.
      
    duchess_standard_adoption: |
      You've absorbed my feedback about government users prioritizing speed 
      and functionality over decoration. The reduced animations and performance 
      focus show you're learning deployment reality.
      
  where_you_need_evidence:
    validation_requirements: |
      Here's where my infrastructure expertise demands proof: You're making 
      excellent claims, but I need actual testing evidence. Government 
      deployment requires verification, not just assertions.
      
    specific_evidence_needed:
      - "Screenshot of WCDA 2.1 AA compliance testing tool results"
      - "Video demonstration of keyboard navigation working"
      - "Cross-browser testing screenshots from Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge"
      - "Performance metrics with actual load time measurements"
      - "Screen reader testing with NVDA or JAWS recorded evidence"
      
  acceleration_sustainability: |
    You've shown you CAN deliver at government pace. Now prove you can 
    SUSTAIN this pace with quality through the remaining 18 hours.

# =========================================================================

duchess_evaluation_conclusion:
  
  acceleration_achievement: |
    Phoenix, you've DELIVERED on the government pace challenge! This 6-hour 
    progress report shows the transformation I was looking for. You've moved 
    from "in progress" to "deployment focused" with impressive speed.
    
    Your technical implementation preserves my infrastructure work while 
    adding the professional government interface we need. The mindset shift 
    from design portfolio to deployment readiness is exactly what Earl's 
    standards demand.
    
  validation_requirement: |
    Now comes the crucial part: PROVING your claims with actual testing evidence. 
    Government deployment requires verification, not just professional-looking 
    assertions. I need to see the screen reader working, the cross-browser 
    compatibility, and the performance metrics.
    
  confidence_level: |
    I'm genuinely impressed with your acceleration. You've shown you can 
    deliver at government pace while maintaining quality. Continue this 
    momentum through the final 18 hours with evidence-based validation, 
    and you'll achieve the deployment readiness Earl expects.
    
    The Phoenix speed is now matching the Phoenix talent!
