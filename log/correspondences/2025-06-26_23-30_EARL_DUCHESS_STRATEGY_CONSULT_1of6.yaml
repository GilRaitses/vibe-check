# =========================================================================
# üëë DUCHESS PEER-LEVEL RECOMMENDATION
# =========================================================================

duchess_strategic_recommendation:
  
  optimal_coordination_approach:
    observation: |
      Earl, based on my infrastructure work and Phoenix's UI capabilities, 
      I believe we can achieve complete surface harmonization efficiently.
      
      My BigQuery ML pipeline is ready for pedestrian data integration, 
      Phoenix's design system can unify all interfaces, and the technical 
      foundation supports rapid expansion.
      
    recommendation: |
      If the pedestrian agent work is substantially complete, Phoenix should 
      focus on unified UI harmonization across all surfaces. If pedestrian 
      work needs completion, we should coordinate parallel development.

# =========================================================================
# ‚ö° IMMEDIATE STRATEGIC DECISIONS NEEDED
# =========================================================================

immediate_decisions_required:
  
  within_4_hours:
    ‚òê "Earl provides pedestrian agent status and completion assessment"
    ‚òê "Strategic direction for Phoenix: dashboard focus vs broader integration"
    ‚òê "Authority approval for Duchess infrastructure expansion"

# üëë DUCHESS CONSULTATION CONCLUSION
# =========================================================================

consultation_conclusion:
  authority_acknowledgment: |
    Earl, I'm consulting you as a peer because your strategic oversight 
    combined with my infrastructure expertise can achieve complete NYC 
    deployment efficiency.
    
    Phoenix is ready for acceleration, my infrastructure is proven and 
    expandable, and we need your guidance on optimal surface harmonization.
    
  strategic_confidence: |
    Whatever the pedestrian modeling status, we can integrate it rapidly. 
    The technical foundation is solid, the team coordination is effective, 
    and government deployment is within reach.
    
    Your strategic guidance will ensure we maximize efficiency and achieve 
    complete surface harmonization for NYC readiness.
