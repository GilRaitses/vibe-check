agent_notes: |
  All validation report issues have been comprehensively addressed in code implementation.
  The BigQuery dataset naming is corrected, ARIMA_PLUS model training is fully implemented
  with logging and metrics, and Redis connection stability has been enhanced with retry
  logic and health checks. The deployment blocker appears to be an infrastructure
  configuration issue unrelated to the validation fixes themselves.
