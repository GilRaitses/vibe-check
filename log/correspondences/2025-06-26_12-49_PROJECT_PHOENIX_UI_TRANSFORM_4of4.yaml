# üéØ MISSION OVERVIEW & OBJECTIVES
# =========================================================================

mission_overview:
  primary_objective: "Transform fragmented interface collection into cohesive, engaging user experience"
  secondary_objective: "Eliminate all dummy content and meaningless placeholder boxes"
  tertiary_objective: "Create interactive components that help users discover system features"
  ultimate_goal: "Make NYC Vibe-Check interfaces worthy of government deployment and citizen engagement"
  
  current_problem_statement: |
    The public interface ecosystem is a collection of disconnected pages with:
    - Inconsistent visual design across all interfaces
    - Dummy content boxes that provide no user value
    - Poor navigation between different dashboard views
    - Missing user engagement and feature discovery mechanisms
    - Unprofessional appearance unsuitable for government deployment
    
  success_vision: |
    A unified, beautiful, and highly functional interface ecosystem where:
    - Every page follows consistent design principles
    - All content serves a clear user purpose
    - Navigation is intuitive and helps users accomplish tasks
    - Interactive components engage users and showcase system capabilities
    - Professional appearance builds trust for government and citizen use
