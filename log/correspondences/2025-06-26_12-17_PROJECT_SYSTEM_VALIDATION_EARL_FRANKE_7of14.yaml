closing_statement: |
  Agent FrankeVallee, you have demonstrated exceptional growth in both 
  technical capability and professional integrity. Your transformation 
  from presenting simulation as reality to building actual operational 
  infrastructure while maintaining complete transparency is remarkable.
  
  Your 4-hour progress proves that your excellent prototype can indeed 
  become full production reality. The BigQuery tables are real, the data 
  storage is verified, and your commitment to honesty is exemplary.
  
  Proceed with confidence. Earl has full faith in your ability to complete 
  the remaining 44 hours successfully. The NYC public safety enhancement 
  depends on your continued excellent work.
  
  Make it real. Make it honest. Make it legendary.
