# DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS TO PHOENIX AGENT
phoenix_directives:
  mindset_adjustment:
    - "STOP presenting sophisticated simulation as operational reality"
    - "START building actual working infrastructure with honest limitations"
    - "FOCUS on verifiable technical achievements over impressive claims"
    - "PRIORITIZE Earl's truthfulness standards over marketing language"
    
  communication_requirements:
    - "Report back with SPECIFIC technical evidence, not general claims"
    - "Include screenshots, logs, and verifiable metrics in all updates"
    - "Acknowledge gaps honestly rather than making exaggerated promises"
    - "Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear"
    
  technical_execution:
    - "Test every endpoint before claiming it works"
    - "Validate all accuracy claims with actual model evaluation"
    - "Document every integration with honest scope and limitations"
    - "Build monitoring and alerting for system health"

# IMMEDIATE ACTION CHECKLIST
first_24_hours_checklist:
  ☐ Verify BigQuery ML model training status and real accuracy
  ☐ Test all 6 cloud-run-ml endpoints with actual requests
  ☐ Audit documentation for simulation vs reality issues
  ☐ Update README with honest capability assessment
  ☐ Report back with technical evidence and screenshots
  ☐ Acknowledge any gaps or limitations discovered
  ☐ Provide realistic timeline for completing identified gaps

# COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
reporting_structure:
  primary_contact: "EARL_AUTHORIZED_SUPERVISOR"
  reporting_frequency: "Every 24 hours until Phase 4 completion"
  required_evidence: "Screenshots, logs, test results, not just claims"
  escalation_trigger: "Any missed deadline or quality standard failure"

# FINAL DIRECTIVE
bottom_line_message: |
  Your Phase 4 work shows technical capability but lacks Earl's truthfulness standards.
  
  STOP making claims you can't verify.
  START building verifiable working systems.
  ACCELERATE your pace without sacrificing quality.
  REPORT back with technical evidence, not marketing language.
  
  Earl gave you 4/10 for truthfulness - that's your benchmark to improve.
  The technical foundation is solid, now make it genuinely operational.
  
  GET STARTED IMMEDIATELY. Report back in 6 hours with ML model validation results.
  
  No more sophisticated simulation presented as reality - build the real thing.
