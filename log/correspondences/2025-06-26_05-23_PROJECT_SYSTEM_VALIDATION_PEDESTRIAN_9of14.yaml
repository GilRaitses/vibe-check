final_recommendation: |
  The Pedestrian Route Analyzer implementation demonstrates excellent technical
  skills and visual design matching Google Maps standards. However, critical
  production build failures and policy violations prevent deployment approval.
  The agent must address Google Maps SSR issues and emoji policy compliance
  before resubmission. The core implementation is solid and shows great promise
  once technical blockers are resolved.

agent_feedback: |
  Excellent technical implementation and visual design skills demonstrated.
  The Google Maps integration and polyline generation is professional-grade.
  However, the agent failed to properly test production builds and ignored
  explicit user policy requirements. Recommend implementing proper testing
  procedures and policy compliance verification before making deployment claims.
