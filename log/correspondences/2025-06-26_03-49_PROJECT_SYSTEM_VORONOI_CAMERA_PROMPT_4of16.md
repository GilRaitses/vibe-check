# 🗺️ NYC CAMERA VORONOI TESSELLATION ANALYSIS REQUEST
## For Agent with No Prior Project Knowledge

### MISSION OVERVIEW
You are tasked with analyzing the NYC Vibe-Check camera surveillance system to identify cameras that are NOT properly included in Voronoi tessellation cells and provide solutions to fix the geographic coverage gaps.

### PROJECT CONTEXT (What You Need to Know)
This is a real-time NYC traffic violation detection system using 900+ NYC DOT cameras. The system uses Voronoi tessellation to divide NYC into geographic zones for efficient monitoring, but some cameras may be missing from the tessellation or incorrectly assigned to boroughs.

### YOUR SPECIFIC TASK
**Primary Objective**: Find cameras that are NOT included in Voronoi cells and determine why they're excluded, then provide actionable solutions to include them properly in their respective NYC boroughs.

### DATA FILES TO ANALYZE
You have access to these critical data files in the `/data/` directory:

1. **`data/nyc-cameras-full.json`** - Complete NYC camera dataset (~937 cameras)
   - Contains: camera IDs, coordinates (lat/lng), borough assignments, image URLs
   
2. **`data/complete_voronoi_zones.json`** - Current Voronoi tessellation (~907 zones)
   - Contains: zone polygons, camera assignments, geographic boundaries
   
3. **`data/zone-lookup.json`** - Zone metadata (~918 zones)
   - Contains: zone IDs, handles, coordinates, borough assignments
   
4. **`data/nyc_boroughs_land_only.geojson`** - NYC borough boundaries
   - Contains: Official NYC borough polygons (excluding water)

### ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

#### Phase 1: Data Inventory
- [ ] Count total cameras in `nyc-cameras-full.json`
- [ ] Count total zones in `complete_voronoi_zones.json`
- [ ] Identify the numerical gap (cameras vs zones)
- [ ] List cameras by borough from source data

#### Phase 2: Geographic Validation
- [ ] Cross-reference camera coordinates with borough boundaries
- [ ] Identify cameras outside NYC land boundaries
- [ ] Find cameras in water/invalid locations
- [ ] Detect coordinate errors (lat/lng swapped, decimal issues)

#### Phase 3: Voronoi Coverage Analysis
- [ ] Map each camera to its nearest Voronoi zone
- [ ] Identify cameras >500m from any Voronoi center
- [ ] Find cameras assigned to wrong boroughs
- [ ] Detect clustering issues (too many cameras, too few zones)

#### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis
Investigate these potential issues:
- **Coordinate Errors**: Invalid lat/lng values
- **Borough Misassignment**: Cameras tagged with wrong borough
- **Water Exclusion**: Cameras near water excluded from tessellation
- **Edge Cases**: Cameras on borough boundaries
- **Data Inconsistency**: Different camera counts across files

### ANALYSIS TOOLS & COMMANDS

#### Data Exploration Commands
```bash
# Count cameras by file
jq '. | length' data/nyc-cameras-full.json
jq '. | length' data/complete_voronoi_zones.json
jq '. | length' data/zone-lookup.json

# Examine camera structure
jq '.[0]' data/nyc-cameras-full.json

# Check coordinate ranges
jq '[.[].latitude] | min, max' data/nyc-cameras-full.json
jq '[.[].longitude] | min, max' data/nyc-cameras-full.json

# Borough distribution
jq 'group_by(.borough) | map({borough: .[0].borough, count: length})' data/nyc-cameras-full.json
```

#### Geographic Validation
```bash
# Find potential coordinate errors
jq '.[] | select(.latitude < 40.4 or .latitude > 40.9 or .longitude < -74.3 or .longitude > -73.7)' data/nyc-cameras-full.json

# Check for missing coordinates
jq '.[] | select(.latitude == null or .longitude == null or .latitude == "" or .longitude == "")' data/nyc-cameras-full.json
```

### COMMON ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE

#### 1. Coordinate Problems
- **Invalid coordinates**: Lat/lng outside NYC bounds
- **Swapped coordinates**: Longitude in latitude field
- **Precision errors**: Too few decimal places
- **Missing data**: Null or empty coordinate fields

#### 2. Borough Assignment Issues
- **Misclassified cameras**: Camera coordinates don't match assigned borough
- **Edge cases**: Cameras on borough boundaries
- **Inconsistent naming**: Borough name variations

#### 3. Tessellation Algorithm Issues
- **Water exclusion**: Algorithm excluding cameras near water
- **Clustering problems**: Multiple cameras creating single zone
- **Distance thresholds**: Cameras too far from zone centers
- **Boundary constraints**: Tessellation not respecting borough boundaries

### EXPECTED TIMELINE
- **Data Analysis**: 1-2 hours
- **Geographic Validation**: 1 hour  
- **Report Generation**: 30 minutes
- **Solution Development**: 1 hour
- **Total**: 3-4 hours

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
Your analysis is successful if you:
1. **Identify exact number of missing cameras** with specific IDs
2. **Categorize exclusion reasons** with clear explanations
3. **Provide actionable fixes** with step-by-step implementation
4. **Validate solutions** against NYC borough boundaries
5. **Deliver comprehensive report** in the requested YAML format

### DEBUGGING HINTS
- NYC latitude range: ~40.4 to 40.9
- NYC longitude range: ~-74.3 to -73.7
- Expected camera density: ~150-200 per borough
- Voronoi zones should roughly equal camera count
- Check for duplicate cameras or zones
- Verify borough spelling consistency

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Please provide your analysis as a comprehensive markdown report with:
1. **Executive Summary** (key findings)
2. **Detailed Analysis** (data investigation results)  
3. **YAML Reports** (structured data as specified above)
4. **Implementation Plan** (step-by-step fixes)
5. **Validation Strategy** (how to verify fixes work)

- Understand exactly which cameras are missing from Voronoi tessellation
- Know why they're excluded (root cause analysis)
- Implement specific fixes to include all cameras properly
- Verify the fixes work correctly
- Ensure complete NYC geographic coverage

**Start your analysis immediately and provide a thorough investigation of the Voronoi tessellation coverage gaps.**
