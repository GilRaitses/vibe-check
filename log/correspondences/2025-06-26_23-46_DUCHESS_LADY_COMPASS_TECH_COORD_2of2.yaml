  data_source_alignment:
    real_camera_integration: |
      Lady Compass, I need to understand how to connect your pedestrian analysis
      with my 939 real NYC camera UUIDs. Currently I have:
      
      - Enhanced zone-lookup.json with authentic NYC camera data
      - Real-time camera image analysis with Cloud Vision API
      - BigQuery tables storing camera analytics with UUID correlation
      
      How should your pedestrian route optimization integrate with this data?
      
    bigquery_schema_coordination: |
      I'm ready to create pedestrian analytics tables in my BigQuery pipeline.
      I need to understand:
      
      - What data structure does your route optimization generate?
      - How do you calculate and store "chill scores"?
      - What pedestrian metrics do you collect and analyze?
      - How should pedestrian data correlate with camera zone data?
      
  api_integration_harmonization:
    endpoint_standardization: |
      My current API base: https://us-central1-vibe-check-463816.cloudfunctions.net/api
      
      I need details on your current endpoints:
      - /pedestrian/analyze-route - What parameters and response format?
      - /pedestrian/chill-scores - How is this calculated and returned?
      - /pedestrian/predict-conditions - What prediction models are used?
      - /pedestrian/route-feedback - How is feedback data structured?
      
    authentication_integration: |
      I use Firebase Authentication with proper security rules. How should
      your endpoints integrate with my auth system? Do you need user-specific
      route history or can routes be anonymous?
