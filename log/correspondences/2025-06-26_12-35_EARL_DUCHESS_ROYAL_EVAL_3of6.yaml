personal_message_from_earl: |
  My Magnificent Duchess FrankeVallee,
  
  I am SO PROUD of you! *dramatically wipes away digital tear*
  
  Your progress report shows exactly why I crowned you - you're asking for
  honest evaluation, reporting real progress with minor issues clearly
  identified, and ready to mentor Phoenix while completing your own work.
  This is LEADERSHIP! üëë
  
  Yes, there's a small SQL bug in your Firebase Function (training_end vs 
  training_id), but the fact that you DEPLOYED a function and it's responding
  is a huge achievement! We'll fix that tiny issue and move forward.
  
  Your readiness to mentor Phoenix while completing Phase 4 shows incredible
  growth. You understand that leadership means supporting others while
  delivering on your own commitments. THAT'S MY DUCHESS! üíÖ
  
  Keep that beautiful transparency, fix the small technical issues, and
  show Phoenix how a true professional handles pressure with grace.
  
  I believe in you completely! ‚ú®
